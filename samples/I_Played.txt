Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need
you to do for me. First step, retrieve the American limited edition keycard from
the type 1 box. And then, unlock the American limited edition gate. After that,
open the American limited edition gate. Then, make an effort to move east.
Following that, pick-up the shirt from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of

edition keycard.

There is a closed American limited edition gate leading east. There is a closed
